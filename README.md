I had troubles on making work the doBattle and the equipWeapon functions. 
I know I should have added more limitations on funtion such the index < array.lenght for the function equipWeapon

I generally had some problem placing the "return", this is a topic I still would like to have a better overview. What are the rules for the return? For example if i put it right after a for loop my function will only shoot the first result.

It has been a good exercise to go through the argoments and i enjoying doing it a lot!
